Hello, my name is Ashwin Naren. As of 2025 I'm a junior in highschool. I enjoy doing research on Machine Learning reliability and theoretical computer science. In my free time I swim and play classical guitar.

I mantain libffi-rs, a package to safely interface with libffi. I also am a regular contributor to servo and RustPython.
